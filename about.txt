Back in 1968 a rancher by the name of Lucas Brown decided the life of a cowboy was no longer his passion.
   He decided to get into accounting and start a new life in the big city. Lucas Moved to Manhattan after getting
   his CPA in 1972 and decided to chase his dream of being a successful business man in the big apple. It was there
   where he met his partner Mortimer Schorr, a long time pharmacy shop owner in the lower east side. Mortimer had
   a good standing with the big pharmaceutical companies in Manhattan, but had the savvy of a small business owner.
   In 1976 Maverick Pharmaceutical Accounting was born. Lucas and Mortimer paved the way for a better future and
   forever changed the way accounting was done for the pharmaceutical industry. Maverick has always been about innovation
   and integrity, something that is necessary in the industry. In 1998 Lucas and Mortimer passed down the business to
   their children, Bobby Brown and Maria Schorr, who then took the company into the digital age at the turn of the 
   century. Today Maverick is still a class act, servicing companies big and small, treating each client with the
   up most respect.
